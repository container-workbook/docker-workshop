== What are we looking for?

* Scalability, Maintainability, Agility, Portability.
* Improved resource utilization.
* A continuum of abstraction levels.

== Linux containers

* Using Linux kernel process isolation and resource features to give a VM
like environment.

* docker project is three years old, but linux containers are older than that e.g. LXC.

* Some examples of linux container runtime: https://linuxcontainers.org/[LXC], https://github.com/google/lmctfy[lmctfy], https://github.com/docker/docker/[docker], https://github.com/coreos/rkt[rkt], etc.

== Introducing docker

* Sand boxing of process/Application

* It is an application packaging and delivery mechanism.

* Lightweight container virtualization platform.

== Why Developers Care?

* Build once -> run anywhere*
* A clean, safe, hygienic and portable runtime environment.
* No worries about missing dependencies, packages, etc.
* Automate testing, integration, packaging -> anything you can script.
* It is portable* -> so it reduces the concern about portability.

== Why Operations Care?

* It reduces the time, from developing an application to putting it in to production.
* The entire lifecycle can made more efficient, consistent and repeatable.
* Reduce the inconsistencies between development, test, production and customer environment.
* Because the containers are so light-weight, they significantly address performance, costs, deployment and portability issues.

== docker vs Virtual Machine

* Lighter than Virtual machines.
* Less startup time.
* We can run a lot of containers on a reasonably sized host.
* Deploying and scaling is relatively easy.

== Kernel Features which enables containrization

* Control Groups
* Namespaces
* Union filesystem
* Kernel Security features

=== Namespace

* It helps to create isolated workspace for each process.
* When you run a container, docker creates a set of namespaces for that container.


=== Cgroup

* Control Groups are another key component of Linux Containers.
* With Cgroup we can implement resource accounting and limiting.
* Ensure that each container gets its fair share of memory, CPU, disk I/O.
* Thanks to Cgroup, we can make sure that single container cannot bring the system down by exhausting resources.

=== Kernel Security features

* Capabilities
** By default docker drops all capabilities except those needed.
** "root" within a container has much less privileges than the real "root".
** The best practice for users would be to remove all capabilities except those explicitly required for their processes.
** Even if an intruder manages to escalate to root within a container, it will be much harder to do serious damage, or to escalate to the host

* Other kernel security features: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/TOMOYO_Linux[TOMOYO], https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AppArmor[AppArmor], https://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/SELinux[SELinux], https://grsecurity.net/[GRSEC], etc.

=== SELinux

* https://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/SELinux[SELinux] provides secure separation of containers by applying SELinux policy and labels. 

== docker Components

* *Image* : It is a template which is used to launch containers. 

* *Container* : Container holds everything that is needed for an application to run.

* *Registry* : It stores and serves up the actual image assets, and it delegates authentication to the index.

* *Index* : It is the front end of Registry. It manages user accounts, permissions, search, tagging, and all that nice stuff that’s in the public web interface

== Prerequisite for the workshop

* You should be able to run docker command line on your workstation or in a VM or a machine running in public clouds.

* We will recommend you to run a GNU/Linux distribution of your choice on your laptop or atleast a virtual machine. Then you should install docker on it.

** Most of the Linux distributions e.g. Fedora provides you the docker package from the distribution it self.

** Refer the below section for commands to install it on Fedora.

* Before coming for the workshop, pull docker image of Fedora as conferences are not a good place to download stuff from internet.

$ docker pull fedora
